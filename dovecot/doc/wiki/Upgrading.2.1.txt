Upgrading Dovecot v2.0 to v2.1
==============================

v2.1 is mostly compatible with v2.0 configuration, except:

 * <Plugins.txt> now use UTF-8 mailbox names rather than mUTF-7: acl,
   autocreate, expire, trash, virtual
 * Usernames in authentication are now lowercased by default.
    * Non-lowercase usernames in password/user database result in "unknown
      user" errors
    * To allow mixed case usernames again, set 'auth_username_format=' (i.e. to
      empty)
 * <Solr> [Plugins.FTS.Solr.txt] full text search backend changed to use
   mailbox GUIDs instead of mailbox names, requiring reindexing everything.
   solr_old backend can be used with old indexes to avoid reindexing, but it
   doesn't support some newer features.
 * <Expire plugin> [Plugins.Expire.txt]: Only go through users listed by userdb
   iteration. Delete dict rows for nonexistent users, unless
   expire_keep_nonexistent_users=yes.
 * <dsync> [Tools.Dsync.txt] was merged into doveadm. There is still "dsync"
   symlink pointing to "doveadm", which you can use the old way for now. The
   preferred ways to run dsync are "doveadm sync" (for old "dsync mirror") and
   "doveadm backup".
 * dsync protocol isn't compatible with v2.0's dsync, so you can't dsync
   between v2.0 and v2.1 servers.
